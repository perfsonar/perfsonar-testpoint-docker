        ####
        # If you want to publish that only certain tests are allowed on certain interfaces
        # then you need to first do the following:
        #    1. Set autodiscover_interfaces to 0 above
        #    2. List each interface you want published in an interface block
        # Inside the interface block you can define what tests you want run a few different
        # ways. See examples below:
        #
        ##
        ## This interface will only allow throughput and trace tests. It explicitly defines
        ## the tests it supports.
        #<interface>
        #     if_name eth0
        #     disable_autodiscover_tests 1
        #     test throughput
        #     test trace
        #</interface>
        #
        ## This interface will allow any type of test EXCEPT throughput. It will
        ## contact pscheduler for the list of installed plug-ins and will everything
        ## except throughput. You can define disable_test multiple times to disable multiple
        ## tests
        ## the tests it supports.
        #<interface>
        #    # don't run throughput tests
        #    if_name eth1
