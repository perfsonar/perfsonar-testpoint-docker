## perfSONAR 5.0x Testpoint docker container

NOTE: This now seems to be working. Testers needed. Please submit problems to:
  https://github.com/perfsonar/perfsonar-testpoint-docker/issues

The docker container runs all perfSONAR 5.0x Services in the "Testpoint" bundle, as described at:
http://docs.perfsonar.net/install_options.html

This can be used to run perfSONAR 5.0x Testpoint services on any OS that supports docker.

Download the container:
>docker pull perfsonar/testpoint

To register your perfSONAR testpoint, start a container shell, and edit the file
/etc/perfsonar/lsregistrationdaemon.conf with the location and administrator information for your site.

If this host will be part of a centrally configured mesh, also edit the file 
/etc/perfsonar/meshconfig-agent.conf, and update the 'configuration_url'.

>docker run -it perfsonar/testpoint /bin/bash

After editing the configuration files, exit the container and commit the change.
> docker commit -m "added config settings" containerID perfsonar/testpoint

Run the container:
>docker run --privileged -d --net=host perfsonar/testpoint

### Systemd based container (optional)

Besides the default version based on supervisord, there is also a testpoint container based on systemd.

To run this version:
>docker pull perfsonar/testpoint:systemd  
>docker run -d --net=host --tmpfs /run --tmpfs /tmp -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro perfsonar/testpoint:systemd

Or, build and run it using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):
>docker-compose -f docker-compose.systemd.yml build  
>docker-compose -f docker-compose.systemd.yml up -d  

## Testing

Test the perfSONAR tools from another host with pscheduler and owamp installed:
>owping hostname

>pscheduler task clock --source hostname --dest localhost
>pscheduler task throughput --dest hostname

## Troubleshooting

To get a shell in the Docker container on your host, run 'docker ps -a' to get your container ID, 
and then run:
>docker exec -it containerID bash

## Notes:
The perfSONAR hostname/IP is assumed to be the same as the base host. To use a different
name/IP for the perfSONAR container, see: https://docs.docker.com/articles/networking/
It also assumes the base host is running NTP, and not running httpd, postgres, or anything else 
listening on the list of ports below.

## Security:
make sure the following ports are allowed by the base host:
 pScheduler: 443 ; owamp:861, 8760-9960
